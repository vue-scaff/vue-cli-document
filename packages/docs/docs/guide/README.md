# Introduction

<Bit/>

<font color="#f63"><b>Vue Scaff</b></font> arms to be a progressive vue-engineering scaffold for help Developers build and deploy apps simply. It ensures the various projects work smoothly with sensible defaults. Then you can focus on writing your app instead of spending days wrangling with configurations. As the same time, it still offers the flexibility to tweak the config of each part without the need for ejecting. From free to open source, vue-scaff makes app creation lightning fast. ðŸ’¯

## How It Works

Vue-Scaff based on [vue-cli-ecosystem](https://cli.vuejs.org/). A vue-scaff project is in fact a web application powered by [Vue](http://vuejs.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/), [Vue-Cli-Plugin](https://cli.vuejs.org/dev-guide/plugin-dev.html) and `Auto-Registry`.

Each page generated by Vue-Scaff is developed using [Vue](https://cli.vuejs.org/). It can auto-registry [routes](https://router.vuejs.org/), [modules](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [components](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-component) and more, when in process of development. And also can enjoy the convenience of [vue.config.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/)
